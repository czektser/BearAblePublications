# BearAblePublications

## Project Vision:
To allow all publications written by Baylor Faculty along with associated grants to be auto-populated from designated sources. Once the publications are in the BearAble system, authenticated users can add publications and grants, as well as blacklist publications for publications authored by the authenticated user. Users with baylor.edu email addresses can register for an ac- count and authenticate by requesting a token via email. A system administrator can create and remove users, publications, grants and departments as well as blacklist sources.
Unauthenticated users can view publications by department via the UI or a RSS feed plugin. The publications will include links to the DOI, citations, and statistics. Publications loaded into the UI will be cached for 7 days since they were last requested.
This allows for students and professors to focus on their work instead of manually adding publications.
